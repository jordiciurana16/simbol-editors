# Angular 19 Lint Docker Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate project for Angular applications, designed to streamline development with a focus on best practices and ease of setup. The project is integrated with the following tools and features:

	•	ESLint: For consistent and configurable linting.
	•	Prettier: For automatic code formatting to ensure a uniform code style.
	•	Husky: For precommit hooks that run linting and formatting checks before commits.
	•	Docker: Containerized environment for easy and reproducible development setups.

## Features:
	•	Standard Angular Host: The application runs on the default Angular development server with no additional configurations needed.
	•	Organized Imports: Imports are automatically managed and organized for clarity and consistency.
	•	Simplified Asset Handling: Assets are configured to be referenced without specifying the full path. For example, you can use dog.jpg directly instead of assets/dog.jpg.

This boilerplate is perfect for Angular projects that require a quick and clean setup with essential tools already configured.
